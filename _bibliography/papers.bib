  title={Long Memory Conditional Heteroscedasticity in Count Data},
  author={Segnon, Mawuli and Stapper, Manuel},
  abstract = {This paper introduces a new class of integer-valued long memory processes
that are adaptations of the well-known FIGARCH(p, d, q) process of Baillie (1996) and
HYGARCH(p, d, q) process of Davidson (2004) to a count data setting. We derive the
statistical properties of the models and show that reasonable parameter estimates are
easily obtained via conditional maximum likelihood estimation. An empirical applica-
tion with financial transaction data illustrates the practical importance of the models.},

  title={Count Data Time Series Modelling in Julia—The CountTimeSeries.jl Package and Applications},
  author={Stapper, Manuel},
  abstract = {A new software package for the Julia language, CountTimeSeries.jl, is under review, which provides likelihood based methods for integer-valued time series. The package’s functionalities are showcased in a simulation study on finite sample properties of Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation and three real-life data applications. First, the number of newly infected COVID-19 patients is predicted. Then, previous findings on the need for overdispersion and zero inflation are reviewed in an application on animal submissions in New Zealand. Further, information criteria are used for model selection to investigate patterns in corporate insolvencies in Rhineland-Palatinate. Theoretical background and implementation details are described, and complete code for all applications is provided online. The CountTimeSeries package is available at the general Julia package registry.},
